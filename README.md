## About
In this repository, we break down programming concepts into everyday scenarios and analogies. Our goal is to make learning fun and intuitive.

## How to Use
Navigate through the folders to find various programming concepts. Each folder contains markdown files with explanations and analogies:
- **OOP**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts explained through real-world objects.
- **Design Patterns**: Analogies for common design patterns in software development.
- **SOLID Principles**: Real-life examples for SOLID principles.
- **System Design**: Analogies to understand system design concepts.
- **Azure**: Real-life scenarios to explain Azure services and architecture.

## Topics Covered
- **OOP**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.
- **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **System Design**: Scalability, Load Balancing, Caching, etc.
- **Azure**: Application Gateway, Storage, Networking, etc.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! If you have a real-life analogy for a programming concept, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure your analogies are clear and well-explained.
