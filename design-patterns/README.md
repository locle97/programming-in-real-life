# Design Patterns in Real Life

Welcome to the "Design Patterns in Real Life" repository. This repository aims to help you understand and remember various design patterns by linking them to real-life analogies and examples.

## Structure

The repository is organized into three main categories, each representing a type of design pattern:

1. **Creational Patterns**
   - These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
   
2. **Structural Patterns**
   - These patterns deal with object composition or structure. They focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help manage how objects interact and communicate with each other.

## Folders

- **Creational/**: Contains examples and explanations of Creational Design Patterns using relatable real-life analogies.
- **Structural/**: Contains examples and explanations of Structural Design Patterns using relatable real-life analogies.
- **Behavioral/**: Contains examples and explanations of Behavioral Design Patterns using relatable real-life analogies.

## How to Use This Repository

Each folder contains markdown files with stories and explanations to help you grasp the concepts of each design pattern. You can navigate to the specific folder and read the files to understand how these patterns work and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Contribution

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional real-life examples, feel free to contribute by creating a pull request.
