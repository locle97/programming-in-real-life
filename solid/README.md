# SOLID Principles in Real Life

Welcome to the "SOLID Principles in Real Life" repository. This repository aims to help you understand and remember the SOLID principles by linking them to real-life analogies and examples.

## Structure

The repository is organized into five main principles, each representing a core tenet of object-oriented design:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This means that a class should only have one job or responsibility.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This means that subclasses should extend the behavior of the superclass without changing its original behavior.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. This means that larger interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones so that clients only need to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This means you should rely on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
